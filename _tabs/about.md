Hello, my name is Harii.

I created this website to share my home lab projects, cybersecurity experiments, and document my participation in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

I've recently completed my studies in Audio and Music Technology at the University of the West of England, and I've since decided to focus on my passion for IT and cybersecurity. I'm currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification and actively exploring both offensive and defensive tools, with the long-term goal of pursuing a career in red teaming.

You can find links to my social media and email at the bottom of the navigation panel.

Thanks for stopping by!
